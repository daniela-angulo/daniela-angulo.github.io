**What is this about?** This is a website to share my projects and thoughts related to physics and education. Maybe even cycling.

# What do I do? Who am I? 

This website is by no means complete, I'll keep working on it but it's an exciting project for me. 

I'm Daniela and I'm from Colombia. I do a PhD in experimental quantum optics and I guess I say this first because the PhD is what takes most of my time. 

I also work as a high school teacher for grade 12. I teach physics to a small group of amazing kids. 

I love sports and music. Cycling, swimming, running. Playing the guitar and singing. 

# Research topics explained
As a I said, I devote a lot of my time to studying quantum optics. I'll use this section to tell you about some research topics that interest me or my own research. 

In our research group, we have to present a paper of our choice every three months or so to the rest of the group (journal club). I work with atoms and photons but photons are my biggest love so I usually take those presentations as an opportunity to talk about photonics research. 

I must say that I used to have a lot of difficulties with these presentations for the first two years of my PhD. I wasn't able to grasp the big ideas of the subjects and didn't exactly know what questions to ask to clarify the things I didn't understand. But now I've got much better at it and my prof even said how impressed he was with the pedagogical angle of my presentations. According to him, I was raising interesting questions and forcing the audience to think. 


### How much time do photons spend in the excited state? (my thing)

When a particle of light (a photon) travels through a cloud of atoms, it will meet one of two fates: either it will be transmitted through the cloud, or it will be absorbed by an atom, exciting it, and subsequently 'ejected' in a random direction when the atom decays to its ground state (de-excitation). It is straightforward to calculate how often photons are 'lost' in this way, and one can even calculate how long the average photon spends 'inside' an atom. An interesting question arises in this scenario: does the time that a photon spends inside an atom depend on its eventual fate? In other words, if a photon passes through a cloud of atoms without being lost, should we conclude that it never interacted with an atom, and therefore spent no time as an atomic excitation? This question turns out to be surprisingly challenging to answer theoretically as it entails discussing the 'history' of a quantum particle. However, we decided to take an experimental approach and perform the first experiment to measure the time that a transmitted photon spends as an atomic excitation.

### Creating multimode non-Gaussian states

Ahh! Such beautiful work!
They generate non-Gaussian states by applying the anhilation operator to a single mode of their complicated multimode state (generated with a frequency comb). They can remove a single photon in a mode-selective manner. 

There is a lot to unpack in this paper, I'll try to write more in the next few days. 

# Teaching

### Statement of Teaching Philosophy

I wrote this for a course about Teaching in higher education I took at the University. It reflects my believes and approach to teaching in a classroom. 

> Physics, like every science, is a communal practice. One can start by observing a phenomenon, proposing a set of explanations, and testing them experimentally, usually in collaboration with other people. Even if one could manage to do the testing and experimenting alone, the results and conclusions still need to be communicated to and accepted by a big part of the scientific community to be considered valid. I think the communal character of science should be a key part of teaching physics.

>When students come to class, they bring ideas, preconceptions and all their cultural background. They perceive the information with their senses and interpret it to form a mental image of a concept. I can not possibly tell if their mental image matches the one I am aiming to communicate but I can try to be as clear as possible conveying the fundamentals and creating consensus in the class. That clarity requires that I present information using different approaches to give everyone the opportunity to feel comfortable with their learning preferences; I could use a case study based on a real-life example, an experimental demonstration in class, or computer demonstrations. The students ultimately build their own knowledge and I have to make sure I provide all the tools for them to become active agents in their learning process; not to consume knowledge but to create their own. For this purpose, I include multiple means of engagement and assessment; online education has called my attention to tools like polls, discussion boards, interactive simulations and collective documents that I use to foster collaborative interactions among students. Regarding assessment, I combine traditional approaches along with open ended problems and exploratory projects that do not have a unique answer so students can experience a research-type activity and have freedom to pursue personal interests without feeling pressured about grading.

>A good teacher should connect new ideas to existing ones; make the students feel a bit of discomfort with their preconceptions so they can be motivated to learn scientific ideas. When I teach optics, I often choose mirages to introduce total internal reflection of light. Before presenting any physics, I assess the students’ everyday conceptions and previous knowledge with a survey; some of them might think that mirages in a highway are caused by a reflection caused by water on the road. Then by organizing small discussion groups, they could see how their explanation is incomplete or contradicts others’. Finally, total internal reflection is gradually introduced by a series of steps, some of them are worked in groups, where they have to fill in the gaps. Asking them, for example, to qualitatively describe how the temperature and density of the air changes as you go higher above the road. In this session, the students describe a real world situation using mainly optics and that description is linked to other subjects like thermodynamics. By means of this example, I incorporate another one of my teaching pillars that is to always put physical concepts into context and show the connections between different fields of physics.

>I acknowledge and value how every student is unique and diverse. As a woman in a heavily sexist field like physics, I have reflected and educated myself on equity issues like sexism and racism. I am aware of the fact that these are systemic problems and my individual efforts in a classroom are not going to fix them but it is still a priority for me to address them in my class; I want the students to see my class as a safe and comfortable space for them to be themselves. For that reason, I provide diverse means to participation and evaluation, welcome all questions and constantly encourage them, promote appreciation of others’ thoughts and opinions, and constantly work against my own biases.
>
>I love learning and that keeps me motivated to teach. Working with students always brings something new: a question you had not considered before, completely different approaches to solve a problem, new connections of what is taught in class to nature phenomena, etc. The more I teach, the more I learn. It is not only about understanding the contents on a deeper level, I also need to be constantly looking for better teaching practices and studying the context where my students live to relate better to them.  Besides all the things I learn, I can establish human connections with my students, maintaining professionalism, such that they feel listened and supported and we all feel a bit less lonely by learning together.
