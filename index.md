# Teaching

### Statement of Teaching Philosophy

I wrote this for a course about Teaching in higher education I took at the University. It reflects my believes and approach to teaching in a classroom. 

> Physics, like every science, is a communal practice. One can start by observing a phenomenon, proposing a set of explanations, and testing them experimentally, usually in collaboration with other people. Even if one could manage to do the testing and experimenting alone, the results and conclusions still need to be communicated to and accepted by a big part of the scientific community to be considered valid. I think the communal character of science should be a key part of teaching physics.

>When students come to class, they bring ideas, preconceptions and all their cultural background. They perceive the information with their senses and interpret it to form a mental image of a concept. I can not possibly tell if their mental image matches the one I am aiming to communicate but I can try to be as clear as possible conveying the fundamentals and creating consensus in the class. That clarity requires that I present information using different approaches to give everyone the opportunity to feel comfortable with their learning preferences; I could use a case study based on a real-life example, an experimental demonstration in class, or computer demonstrations. The students ultimately build their own knowledge and I have to make sure I provide all the tools for them to become active agents in their learning process; not to consume knowledge but to create their own. For this purpose, I include multiple means of engagement and assessment; online education has called my attention to tools like polls, discussion boards, interactive simulations and collective documents that I use to foster collaborative interactions among students. Regarding assessment, I combine traditional approaches along with open ended problems and exploratory projects that do not have a unique answer so students can experience a research-type activity and have freedom to pursue personal interests without feeling pressured about grading.

>A good teacher should connect new ideas to existing ones; make the students feel a bit of discomfort with their preconceptions so they can be motivated to learn scientific ideas. When I teach optics, I often choose mirages to introduce total internal reflection of light. Before presenting any physics, I assess the students’ everyday conceptions and previous knowledge with a survey; some of them might think that mirages in a highway are caused by a reflection caused by water on the road. Then by organizing small discussion groups, they could see how their explanation is incomplete or contradicts others’. Finally, total internal reflection is gradually introduced by a series of steps, some of them are worked in groups, where they have to fill in the gaps. Asking them, for example, to qualitatively describe how the temperature and density of the air changes as you go higher above the road. In this session, the students describe a real world situation using mainly optics and that description is linked to other subjects like thermodynamics. By means of this example, I incorporate another one of my teaching pillars that is to always put physical concepts into context and show the connections between different fields of physics.

>I acknowledge and value how every student is unique and diverse. As a woman in a heavily sexist field like physics, I have reflected and educated myself on equity issues like sexism and racism. I am aware of the fact that these are systemic problems and my individual efforts in a classroom are not going to fix them but it is still a priority for me to address them in my class; I want the students to see my class as a safe and comfortable space for them to be themselves. For that reason, I provide diverse means to participation and evaluation, welcome all questions and constantly encourage them, promote appreciation of others’ thoughts and opinions, and constantly work against my own biases.

>I love learning and that keeps me motivated to teach. Working with students always brings something new: a question you had not considered before, completely different approaches to solve a problem, new connections of what is taught in class to nature phenomena, etc. The more I teach, the more I learn. It is not only about understanding the contents on a deeper level, I also need to be constantly looking for better teaching practices and studying the context where my students live to relate better to them.  Besides all the things I learn, I can establish human connections with my students, maintaining professionalism, such that they feel listened and supported and we all feel a bit less lonely by learning together.
